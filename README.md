## Instructions

### Set Up Maven
[Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

### Set Up Git
Set up git on your command line, this just makes it easy to run a spring boot project.
Choose any git client. 

You can use source tree if you'd like, but you'll still need command line to run this.

For windows I use [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)

For Linux and Macs it should already be there.
For Ubuntu you can do an apt-get install if git is not installed already
For Centos you can use yum install if git is not installed
For Mac [See the following](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Clone Project On To Your Machine
Using git please clone on to your computer, you can also use source tree.
git clone (https://github.com/codeglider/longestCommonSubstring.git)
